# Info about the test:
* Total time to do the test: around 5 hours
* List of resources/references being used:
  * Google
  * Drupal.org 
  * Stackoverflow
* As for the last point, which is to provide URL of JSON representation for *page* content type, what I did is to generate that URL just as soon as the Site API Key has been filled. However, it informed that REST module need to enable first for the feature to take affect.
